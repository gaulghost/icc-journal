                  <b>Abstract: </b> Lung cancer becomes a critical disease in
                  human nowadays, and it leads to mortality in many cases.
                  However, the early diagnosis can save the life and increases
                  the patientâ€™s life significantly. Thus, the CT scan is one of
                  the techniques which are used in vital field of imaging in
                  medical areas. This paper provides the novel computer aided
                  diagnosis (CAD) method for finding the lung cancer in the
                  early stages both in male and female. The presented model
                  undergoes Gabor filtering (GF) technique to preprocess the
                  input images to remove the noise exist in it. In addition,
                  watershed based segmentation technique is employed to
                  determine the harmful areas of the lungs from the CT images.
                  At last, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is used for
                  feature extraction and artificial neural networks (ANN) is
                  utilized as a classification. The proposed method is tested
                  and implemented by the use of CT scans image of lungs and it
                  shows the Gabor filter shows the better results and the
                  GLCM-ANN model has led to enhanced diagnostic outcome with
                  higher accuracy of 92.89%.

                  First is utilization of One QR method right now just need
                  their lasting QR code (that is made when the client makes the
                  record right now) this QR Code clients can get the passage in
                  each occasion the main need is the client purchases the ticket
                  for those occasions. The second element of this venture is the
                  utilization of constant database by this kind of database each
                  adjustment in the application is done continuously or the
                  application is quick and work on everybody telephone without
                  giving overwhelming burden to the telephones and the third
                  element of this application utilizes less calculation power on
                  both the server and the customer side.

                  <b>Abstract: </b> Sentiment analysis (SA) involves the task of
                  automatically extracting the sentiments from user reviews via
                  Natural Language Processing (NLP), data mining, and machine
                  learning (ML) models. A major intention of SA is to identify
                  the opinion and sentiments. It becomes helpful in the decision
                  making of the customers whether to purchase an item or not.
                  This paper develops an improved K-means clustering with random
                  forest (RF) classification model called IKC-RF for effective
                  SA. In order to handle the huge amount of online product
                  reviews, K-means clustering technique is utilized to cluster
                  the sentiments into appropriate class labels. Initially, the
                  online product reviews are preprocessed and feature extraction
                  process takes place. Next, clustering process is carried out
                  by K-means clustering and finally, classification is done by
                  RF technique. The application of clustering technique helps to
                  handle the massive increase in dataset. The performance of the
                  IKC-RF model is evaluated and the results are examined under
                  distinct aspects.
